abstract = {Summary All nations have privacy protections for bank customers. The difference between Switzerland and most other nations is the willingness and ability of Swiss banks to defend these rights. This chapter provides a thorough and insightful analysis of the current status and powerful history of Switzerland's bank secrecy laws and enforcement, the origins of which date back hundreds of years. Two world wars, the National Socialist movement in Germany, and efforts of both Swiss and international governments to curtail tax evasion, tax fraud, money laundering, insider trading, terrorist financing, and corruption have transformed these laws and practices.},
